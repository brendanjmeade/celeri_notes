    "## Review of GPs\n",
    "\n",
    "A GP is an infinite-dimensional multivariate normal distribution with a separate dimension for each point in the domain. For simplicity we assume that the mean (a function on points in the domain) is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from the mean, a GP is characterized by a covariance function $C(x, y)$, which is a function on pairs of points in the domain. This corresponds to an operator on functions $f(x)$ given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "C(f)(x) = \\int C(x, y) f(y) \\, dy.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of $C(x, y)$ as a Green's function...\n",
    "\n",
    "Equivalently / dually / inversely, a GP can be characterized by the inverse operator $C^{-1}$ called the precision operator. This operator induces a quadratic form on functions $f(x)$ given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Q(f) = \\int f(x) C^{-1}(f)(x) \\, dx.\n",

    "The Gaussian weight is then proportional to\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the Gaussian process is determined by this quadratic \"distance-squared on functions\". This is what we will investigate and find a natural categorization of: a quadratic measure of \"how big\" or \"how far away from the zero function\" defines a precision operator and hence a covariance function as the corresponding Green's function.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Optional mathematician's note*: This is all summarized in an ad-hoc in order to remain concrete. The correct abstractions make this more elegant. Firstly, a quadratic form is equivalent to an inner product via the polarization identity: $Q(f, g) = \\frac{1}{4} (Q(f + g) - Q(f - g))$, so that $Q(f, f) = Q(f)$. This inner product defines a Hilbert space over some subspace of functions. There is a corresponding dual Hilbert space on functionals. Functionals are linear maps from functions to real numbers. All functionals arise as integration against some a generalized functions (a.k.a. a \"distribution\") with regularity that is dual and opposite to the regularity of the given Hilbert space of functions. For example, if all the functions in the Hilbert space are continuous, then integration against the Dirac delta is a functional in the dual space. The inner product on the dual space is inverse to the inner product on the original Hilbert space. In this case, the covariance $C(x,y)$ is the inner product of Dirac deltas at $x$ and $y$. In summary, under this picture, a quadratic distance-squared on functions is equivalent a Hilbert space of functions. That Hilbert space of functions, is equivalent to some dual Hilbert space of functionals, and that dual Hilbert space is determined by the covariance function, which is an inverse operator on the dual space (restricted to evaluating on the Dirac delta).\n",

    "$$\n",

    "The resulting GP is white noise, where all points are independent. We have to try something else to get something nontrivial.\n",

    "*Optional mathematician's note*: This is the canonical Hilbert space of functions whose inner product is defined as integration of one function against the other. All other Hilbert spaces of functions are defined *relative to this one* by inserting some symmetric positive-definite operator. Namely, if $Q_0(f) = Q_0(f, f) = \\int f(x)^2 \\, dx$ is the $L^2$ inner product, and $C^{-1}$ is a symmetric positive-definite operator, then the corresponding Hilbert space is that of the quadratic form $Q(f) = Q_0(f, C^{-1}f)$. Note that $L^2$ functions are not continuous, and this leads to the Dirac delta singularity appearing in $C(x, y)$.\n",
