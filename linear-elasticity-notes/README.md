# Linear elasticity notes

Here are some draft notes on linear elasticity theory from my particular mathematically-oriented perspective.

Work in progress!

My goal is mainly to gain some intuition about well-posedness and boundary conditions, in particular regarding triangular dislocations.

## Compiling

I'm writing this in [Typst](https://github.com/typst/typst), which is like LaTeX but more modern and less flaky.

For automatic environment setup, I use [pixi](https://pixi.sh).

```bash
pixi run compile
```

To continuously compile,

```bash
pixi run watch
```
